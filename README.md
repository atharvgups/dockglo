# DockBeautifier

A Python prototype that analyzes Dock-click patterns to suggest an optimal order.  
Press one button â†’ your Dock rearranges so the most-used (and most mis-clicked) apps slide into the most convenient spots.

## Setup
```bash
python tracker_sim.py   # simulate data
pytest                  # run tests
python reorder.py       # print suggested order
